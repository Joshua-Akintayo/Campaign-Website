            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone, I'm <span class="text-primary">Akintayo Joshua Jesujuwon. </span>Currently navigating my way through the challenges of fourth-year Mechanical Engineering, I've discovered a passion not just for numbers but for creating brands and businesses that thrive. I specialize in designing systems that simplify complexity and boost success-because life's complicated enough as it is!</p>

          <p>One of my proudest moment was leading the charge for the dean's cup, rallying 10 departments for a showdown that showcased our faculty and others outsid our domain's talent.</p>

          <p>Beyond academics, I've immersed myself in front-end development, cybersecurity, and digital content-skills that fuel my drive to create meaningful change.</p>

          <p>Why am I running for ULES' General Secretary? Picture this. A faculty where every student feel seen, heard and valued. I'm committed to closing the gap between students, their representatives and faculty heads, fostering a community where diverse interests thrive.</p>

          <p>From dynamic workshops to vibrant events, I envision a place where we excel not only in our studies but also in exploring passions that ignite our curiosity. Approachable and empathetic? Absolutely. I thrive on bringing order to chaos. And when I'm not diving into serious stuff, you might catch me jamming on an instrument-though I'll be the first to admit, I'm far from being the next Mozart lol.</p>

          <p>That said, let's team up to build a faculty where innovation meets heart, and where every voice counts towards our shared success</p>
